**Specs for the app**

- [x] The app should present a list of font families available on the user’s computer
- [ ] There should be a way to see individual font styles associated with each font family
- [x] There are two tabs: “All” and “Favorites”
- [x] Favoriting a font should move it to the favorites tab
- [ ] The user should be able to drag to reorder favorites (please implement this without using libraries)


**We will be evaluating:**

- Tasteful UI and design choices
- Thoughtful React composition
- Well-modeled state management
- Performance of the app
- What you prioritize to build given the time constraints
