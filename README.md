# Paper Font Book

A font viewer app built for Paper.

## Features

- System font detection using Local Font Access API
- Smart font grouping and weight sorting (lightest to heaviest)
- Family and style-based search
- Favorites with drag and drop reordering, saved to localStorage
- Customizable preview text and font size

## Future ideas

I have some ideas on how to make this much better in the future, such as:

- Distinguishing between system fonts and user-installed fonts
- List virtualization
- Implementing more full-fledged DnD:
    - Ghost items
    - Keyboard support
